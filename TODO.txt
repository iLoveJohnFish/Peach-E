PeachEngineRenderingManager:

-need to cleanup the renderwindow that the current scene is being run on, in case the user/me does something retarded and close
the fucking engine before closing the running scene instance lmao (which i just did btw oof)

-cleanup renderwindo so htat we can re run the scene instance once changes have been implemented and shit

-we need to implement JSON reading so that, when the scene is changed inside the editor, it updates the JSON config that 
PeachCore reads from on startup. so that all asset changes and such are reflected appropriately

-The JSON reading capabilities can be repurposesd for REDO/UNDO; AUTOSAVE; EXPOSING VARIABLES FROM SCRIPTS TO
EDITOR.


-try out using raylib as the library that runs the game, and use sfml for the editor maybe? (idk><??)
