-we need to implement JSON reading so that, when the scene is changed inside the editor, it updates the JSON config that 
PeachCore reads from on startup. so that all asset changes and such are reflected appropriately

-The JSON reading capabilities can be repurposesd for REDO/UNDO; AUTOSAVE; EXPOSING VARIABLES FROM SCRIPTS TO
EDITOR.

-FIX BUG: theres a bug where if u force-quit the current running scene when there isnt a scene running, where it causes the 
first instance of a new scene to insta close, then the 2nd time running it works as expected

-IMPLEMENT: finalize command queue implementation, where the main thread issues the load commands, and create commands
at the same time, and batches all update + delete commands into a list to send into the queue for that frame.

-FIX BUG: right now when we try to run the peach engine executable on another machine, it seems like we're missing dll's
like python312.dll, some random vs/vc dll missing; it seems like its dll's that are required to run cpp and python code i think
probably should figure out what needs to be bundled with the engine to actually work on different machines and platforms lmao

-ADD CPACK INSTALLER FOR PYTHON312.DLL TO ENFORCE PYTHON VERSIONING AND MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR
BEGINNERS:
# Install application binaries
install(TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME} RUNTIME DESTINATION bin)

# Include DLLs and redistributables
install(FILES path/to/python312.dll DESTINATION bin)
install(FILES path/to/msvcp140.dll DESTINATION bin) # Example for VC++ redistributable DLL

# CPack configuration
set(CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/License.txt")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "1")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "0")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH "0")
include(CPack)
